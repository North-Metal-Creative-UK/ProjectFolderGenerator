# Project Folder Generator

Currently with version 0.0.1 this is a simple script with a pre-configured simple folder structure and a simple button via `Tools -> North Metal Creative -> Generate Default Project.`

This will generate a root folder with everything under `_Project` which you can rename if you wish.

# Plans for version 1:
- Editor Utillity for generating and saving folder configurations that you can take with you between projects.
- Ability to switch structure profiles.
